# Code of Conduct

REMEMBER - this is a free project you use - the maintainers are not here to look into a crystal ball or take any form of abuse

* Be respectful
* Be concise by providing as much information as possible such as code samples, FULL stack traces, etc 
* Reply to questions back from the maintainer if you want your issue resolved
* Issues are not taken for documentation, samples, tests, etc - only PRs
* Issues are only taken for the latest STABLE version of the library - preview versions of the library can be discussed on the SponsorConnect Discord channel available to sponsors only
* Since UWP is essentially being killed, only PR's are accepted or tier 3 sponsors can post issues for UWP.  I also don't use UWP in ANY professional applications, so the time needs to be justified
